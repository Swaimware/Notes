# My Notes

This is a paragraph.  Only use one line for your paragraph or it will look weird.  Just typing so I can see what this looks like

Here **is** another *paragraph*   `monospaced is cool for code snippets`

## Level Two

Don't use the underscore

Page break with four dashes

----

Hard return  
is two spaces  
followed by line return

differences without
two spaces

and now for a block around

```
Roses are red
violets are blue
```

```js
console.log('hello world')
```

```csharp
 if (command == null) return;
```

others include md son js html css sh
